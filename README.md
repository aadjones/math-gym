# math-gym
This code builds generators of arithmetic problems with custom properties, such as number of digits, type of operation, and difficulty of problem.

## How to run
The most lightweight way to run the .js file is through a browser-based platform like [replit](https://replit.com/). Just paste the file contents there and press 'run.'

## Example output
Below it generates 40 arithmetic problems with adding two-digit numbers. The first batch has no regrouping and the second batch has regrouping in every problem.

    No regrouping:   
    [
    '10 + 82 = 92', '14 + 53 = 67',
    '11 + 68 = 79', '56 + 13 = 69',
    '20 + 46 = 66', '18 + 20 = 38',
    '89 + 10 = 99', '34 + 21 = 55',
    '45 + 31 = 76', '34 + 55 = 89',
    '34 + 31 = 65', '62 + 35 = 97',
    '25 + 21 = 46', '23 + 71 = 94',
    '14 + 15 = 29', '32 + 12 = 44',
    '13 + 81 = 94', '40 + 12 = 52',
    '76 + 23 = 99', '75 + 21 = 96 
    ]
    
    With regrouping: 
    [
      '39 + 36 = 75', '46 + 45 = 91',
      '17 + 27 = 44', '69 + 29 = 98',
      '25 + 29 = 54', '43 + 28 = 71',
      '32 + 58 = 90', '32 + 29 = 61',
      '69 + 22 = 91', '19 + 72 = 91',
      '59 + 23 = 82', '62 + 18 = 80',
      '44 + 46 = 90', '14 + 39 = 53',
      '38 + 43 = 81', '22 + 59 = 81',
      '63 + 28 = 91', '16 + 38 = 54',
      '64 + 27 = 91', '26 + 24 = 50'
    ]
